For they say that blood is the symbol of life, which naturally flows out from the slaughtered animal. And perhaps the differences among the presented animals show the diversity of passions in men. For the creeping things represent (προδείκνυσι) those who have their whole concupiscible appetite dragged down into earthly things, and the beasts those who have aroused their whole irascible appetite towards the destruction of one another, and the birds those who thrust their whole rational part up towards the violence of pride and the haughtiness that comes from it, and speak injustice to the height and set their mouth against heaven (Psalm 72:8-9). The great Peter, as God’s coworker, slaughtered these things by the word of the Spirit, making the first group desirous of heavenly things, the second group gentle (ἡμέρους) and loving and tolerant (ἀνθεκτικούς) towards one another, and the third God-loving and humble."}]}
